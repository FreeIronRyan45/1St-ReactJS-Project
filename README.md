# 1St-ReactJS-Project

So in this first ReactJS project I completed as part of the skill path that I'm learning on Codecademy Pro for front end development skill path I'm current doing (building a app with ReactJS), I used knowledge of HTML, JSX objects, and components. This is the first React Fundamentals project. I'm practicing state management in React.JS. "State" is the "brains" of your component and can help help dynamically render your page. So here, I use Reach components to setup a simple authorization layer. This was completed on 11/20/19. 

File attached is the original code as well as instructions.
